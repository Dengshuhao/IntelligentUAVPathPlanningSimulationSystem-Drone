# IntelligentUAVPathPlanningSimulationSystemS-Drone
Drone  Intelligent UAV path planning simulation system is a software with fine operation control, strong platform integration, omnidirectional model building and application automation. It takes the UAV war between A and B in Zone C as the background. The core function of the system is to plan the UAV route through the simulation platform and verify the output. The data can be imported into the real UAV to make it accurately arrive at any position in the battlefield according to the specified route and support the joint action of multi-person and multi-device formation.

## Solve The Problem

Intelligent UAV path planning simulation system solves the problem that ordinary UAV can not accurately plan the path, and ordinary UAV is not enough support, inconvenient to control, difficult to use in the actual war. This software can be designed for flight mission routes in advance, using a flight simulator unmanned aerial vehicle (uav) in the real-time state of mission, through strengthening unmanned aerial vehicle (uav) in the system against ground station module control, simulation of the unmanned aerial vehicle (uav) group of joint action tactical fighting, sailing and output data for the use of real unmanned aerial vehicle (uav), the uav size short, quick release, huge resource advantage as far as possible.

## Application Scenarios And Benefits

Up to now, more than 40 countries are engaged in the research and production of UAVs, and more than 60 countries are using UAVs. The use of drones on the battlefield is the future of warfare.

The advantage of using this software is that it absorbs the results obtained abroad, recompiles and transplants the operating environment from Linux system to Windows and other operating systems, and uses Python language to write the program except the simulation 3D environment module. The program is easy to maintain and modify. The software interface prepared by PyQT5 integrates each module of the software, adds background prompt function, designs intelligent control scripts to simplify the use process of the system, and integrates FlightGear simulator and MissionPlanner ground station program for visualization, so as to improve the accuracy of real UAV flight path and specify flight plan as the fundamental purpose.
